# WeatherWiz

This is a Vue3/Vuex application that displays weather information for a user's selected location. The application utilizes Vue.js,
Weather API (Openweather api), routes for searching and viewing weather by location, and Vuex for keeping track of saved cities. The user can search for a location by entering the city and state, and the application will display the current weather information for that location. The user can also save a location to their list of saved cities, and the list will persist even after the user closes the application
